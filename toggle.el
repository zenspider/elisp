;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the ability to quickly open a corresponding
;; file for the current buffer by using a bi-directional mapping of
;; regular expression pairs. You can select a mapping style from
;; `toggle-mapping-styles' using the `toggle-style' function or set
;; your default style via the `toggle-mapping-style' variable.

;; There are 7 different mapping styles in this version: zentest,
;; rspec, rails, ruby, objc, c, and cpp. Feel free to submit more and
;; I'll incorporate them.

;;; Example Mapping (ruby style):
;;
;; blah.rb <-> test_blah.rb
;; lib/blah.rb <-> test/test_blah.rb

;;; History:

;; 1.3.1 2008-09-25 Fixed doco & typo in rspec patterns.
;; 1.3.0 2007-05-10 Added tab completion to toggle-style. Suggested by TingWang.
;; 1.2.0 2007-04-06 Interleave bidirectional mappings. Fixed interactive setter.
;;                  Added rspec mappings.
;; 1.1.0 2007-03-30 Initial release to emacswiki.org. Added named styles and bidi.
;; 1.0.0 2006-03-22 Birfday.

;; TODO:
;; It would also be great to be able to toggle between a model and
;; the equivalent controller:
;;   app/models/\\1.rb     => app/controllers/\\1.rb
;; and from the controller to views:
;;   app/controller/\\1.rb => app/views/\\1.rb/
;;
;; I can't do that yet... but we should be able to make the mapping
;; styles list any number of patterns to rotate through. I'll talk to
;; PhilHagelberg about it and try it.
