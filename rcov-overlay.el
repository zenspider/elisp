;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the ability to highlight untested code
;; according to rcov by using rcov's coverage.info serialized
;; data. Also provided are two rake tasks to help generate the needed
;; data.

;; The function `overlay-current-buffer-with-command` is actually
;; quite flexible as it will execute an external command that returns
;; json data specifying regions and colors. It could be used for all
;; sorts of mischief.

;; Special thanks to Phil Hagelberg for writing augment, a much more
;; complete package for doing similar things (but still alpha enough
;; that I needed something working now).

;;; History:

;; 1.2 2009-10-21 Added customizable overlay background color.
;; 1.1 2008-12-01 Added find-project-dir to fix path generation issues.
;; 1.0 2008-01-14 Birfday.

;; If you use hoe and autotest with the autotest/rcov plugin, all of
;; this works straight up. Just fire up autotest, let it do its thing,
;; and you can trigger rcov-buffer to see the coverage on the file.

;;
;; If you do NOT use hoe, then you should add the following to your rake tasks:
;; Add this to your Rakefile:
;;
;; task :rcov_info do
;;   ruby "-Ilib -S rcov --text-report --save coverage.info test/test_*.rb"
;; end

;; task :rcov_overlay do
;;   rcov, eol = Marshal.load(File.read("coverage.info")).last[ENV["FILE"]], 1
;;   puts rcov[:lines].zip(rcov[:coverage]).map { |line, coverage|
;;     bol, eol = eol, eol + line.length
;;     [bol, eol, "#ffcccc"] unless coverage
;;   }.compact.inspect
;; end
